# A list containing route groups. Each route group must have a name and a
# mapping of routes, with an optional description field. Each route mapping may

# You may provide an (absolute, recommended) path to an executable file to out-
# source route resolution to a program. The program will receive the arguments
# as space-separated words, without any shell parsing.
#
# These programs must return a JSON object with either one of the following
# key-value pairs:
#  - "redirect": "some-path-to-redirect-to.com"
#  - "body": The actual body to return.
# For example, to return a page that only prints out `3`, the function should
# return `{"redirect": "3"}`.
#
# These programs must be developed defensively, as they accept arbitrary user
# input. Improper handling of user input can easily lead to anywhere from simple
# flakey responses to remote code execution.
