# A default route, if no route is was matched. If none were matched, the entire

# A list containing route groups. Each route group must have a name and a
# mapping of routes, with an optional description field. Each route mapping may
# contain "{{query}}", which will be populated by the user's search query. This
# input is percent-escaped. If multiple routes are defined, then the later
# defined route is used.
#
# You may provide an (absolute, recommended) path to an executable file to out-
# source route resolution to a program. The program will receive one argument
# only, which is the entire string provided from the user after matching the
# route. It is up to the out-sourced program to parse the arguments and to
# interpret those arguments. These programs should print one line to standard
# out, which should be a fully resolved URL to lead the user to.
#
# These programs must be developed defensively, as they accept arbitrary user
# input. Improper handling of user input can easily lead to anywhere from simple
# flakey responses to remote code execution.
