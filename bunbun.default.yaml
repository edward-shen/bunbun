# You may provide an (absolute, recommended) path to an executable file to out-
# source route resolution to a program. The program will receive one argument
# only, which is the entire string provided from the user after matching the
# route. It is up to the out-sourced program to parse the arguments and to
# interpret those arguments. These programs should print one line to standard
# out, which should be a fully resolved URL to lead the user to.
#
# These programs must be developed defensively, as they accept arbitrary user
# input. Improper handling of user input can easily lead to anywhere from simple
# flakey responses to remote code execution.
